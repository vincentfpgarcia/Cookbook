# Cookbook

## Forewords

In this cookbook, I gather information I think might be useful **for me** in the future. The goal is for me not to forget some knowledge and pieces of code I've met in the past. I am perfectly aware that some of the information shared here might not be correct or even might be misleading. Moreover, what is true today might be wrong tomorrow. I'll try to do my best to keep this repository clean and up-to-date.

I must insist that the targeted user of the information shared here is me and me alone. If it can help someone else, it's a good thing. But I make no promises. Please read the [license](LICENSE) file.
